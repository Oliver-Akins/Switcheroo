something to transfer files
    - Don't retransfer transfered files
    - Transfer files to target output, not on the SD card
        - Maybe option but not default
    - Rename files to be "YYYY-MM-DD.HH-MM.fmt"
        - Custom format options
    - Option to transfer just images (or videos)
        - Option to separate images and videos into different directories?

    - If stored already: don't prompt
