# Nintendo-Switch-Photo-Manager
A simple way to re-organize Nintendo Switch photos based on the game and date.




Overview:

Usage `python3 manage.py [-s | --search | INPUT_FILEPATH] OUTPUT_FILEPATH` (hopefully)

Then it will take the files from the Nintendo/Album directory and move them to the OUTPUT_FILEPATH whilst renaming them to be in the format `YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM:SS` (in either `mp4` or `png` format accordingly.)
